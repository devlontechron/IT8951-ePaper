# Get Photo / Data

if(timer > deviceSetting.refreshTime)
{
    # Connect to server

    # Check for new settings

    #Check for new data

    #Download loacl

    # Display

}


## I want to connect dirrectly to the pi for initial set up
## And somehow force refresh data outside of the refresh time

## i like the email idea for photo sharing

# what does web UI look like? do we actually need this? think about software updates and cpu throughput on device
